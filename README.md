# 🚘 Carwash Buddy (Flutter Application)

Developed a Flutter-based app to help users find nearby car washes with real-time user-reported pricing and operational status. Features include map/general views, navigation, and a dedicated web and in-app view for car wash owners to manage listings and updates.  

Tech stack: **Flutter**, **NextJS**, **NodeJS**, **ExpressJS**, **MongoDB**, **AWS**, **Google Maps**, and **Firebase (Google & Facebook auth).**

Implemented **geohashing** to efficiently store and query latitude/longitude coordinates, enabling fast and accurate **nearby search functionality.**
